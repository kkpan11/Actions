		Returns the Bluetooth device with the given identifier if it's in range and discoverable.

		This can be useful to check if a certain Bluetooth device is connected or in range and perform a specific action based on that.

		Use the “Get Bluetooth Devices” action to discover devices and their identifiers.

		NOTE: You need to allow the Bluetooth permission in the main app before using this action.

		NOTE: You need to have been connected to the device at least once before.

		NOTE: It only works for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) peripherals, not legacy Bluetooth peripherals.

		NOTE: Bluetooth has a lot of limitations on iOS and if this action doesn't work for you, it's unfortunately unlikely there is anything I can do about it.

		NOTE: The `transmitPowerLevel` property is not provided for this action.

		NOTE: The RSSI and signal strength are available for only one of the two AirPods. If it shows RSSI of 0, try the identifier of the other AirPods device.


		> Can you support diconnecting from a device?
		  Third-party apps like Actions cannot disconnect Bluetooth devices. This is an iOS limitation.
